### What
The "Phonie" project aims to streamline the user experience in a web application form by automatically identifying the telecom carrier associated with a user-entered phone number. When a user inputs their phone number into the designated form field, the system will promptly recognize whether it belongs to MTN, GLO, Airtel, Etisalat, or any other carrier. Following this identification, the UI will dynamically display the corresponding telecom carrier's logo or icon next to the form field. This feature ensures a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction, enhancing the overall form-filling experience for the application's users.
